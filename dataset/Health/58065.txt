A friend of mine has a trouble with her ears ringing.  The ringing is so loud

Sometimes I have a problem with doctor's prescribing medicine like
this.  I of course don't know the exact situation, and
anti-depressants may work, but it isn't helping the ringing at all, is it?


>The ringing started rather suddenly about 6 months ago.  She is quickly losing
>sleep, social life and sanity over this.

Mine started about three years back.  Turns out I have tinnitus
bilateral (translation: ringing in both ears, basically ;).  If this
is what it is, she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up
and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with
my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but
you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've
read about it... not just from my own personal experience.

Millions have it, according to my physician.  You just learn to cope
with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually
becomes unconscious.

The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine)
and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes
and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when
it really "kicks in").
