I find my vision is more clear for some things, and less clear for
others, only at night. I notice a definite haloing at night in the
darkness when I look at automobile headlamps, though this is not
something I spend inordinate amounts of time doing. For ordinary
things, my vision, in particular having a fully-operating peripheral
vision, is clearer than with glasses, or contacts.
