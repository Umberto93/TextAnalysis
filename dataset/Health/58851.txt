I've taken Septra.  My daughter has taken it many times for ear
infections.  It works sometimes.  It is a sulfa drug.  About the only
problem I found was that I'm sensitive and developed a rash after nine
days of a ten day course.  No more Septra for me.  My doctor was
remiss in not telling me to watch out for a rash.  I was quite in the
dark and didn't realize that it could be a drug reaction.  No harm
done though.
