I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post in
this thread.  In case this puzzles people, I would like to expand
on two of her comments.

One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning
about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,
scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of
evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the
back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be
filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a
grave mistake to confuse these.
