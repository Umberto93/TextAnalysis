This will be the first of monthly postings of the newsletter of 
the Long Island Chapter of the Transplant Recipients 
International Organization (TRIO).  Unfortunately, I was unable 
to post it before the date of this month's meeting.  I'm 
posting it anyway, and posting it world-wide instead of 
regional, in the hopes that some of the information may be 
useful or illustrative.  Also, I hope it can be used as an 
example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters 
and data related to organ transplantation and donation.
