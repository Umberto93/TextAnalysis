If this theory were true, the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy
(evidence of acute loss of enlarged motor units); it doesn't.
Instead, the biopsy shows scattered, angulated, atrophic fibers.
This is more consistent with load-shedding by chronically overworked
motor neurons - the neurons survive, at the expense of increasingly
denervated muscle.
