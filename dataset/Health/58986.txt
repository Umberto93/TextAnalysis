Hmmm... even  *without*  the  ;-)  at the end, I didn't think anyone
 was going to take the mathematics or statistics of my post seriously.
 
 I only hope that you had the same thing in mind with your post, 
 otherwise you would need at least TWO  ;-)'s  at the end to help 
 anyone understand your calculations above...
