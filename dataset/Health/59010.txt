I am sorry to once again bother those of you on this newsgroup. 
If you have any suggestions as to where I might find out about the subject
of this letter (the origin of Morphine, ie. who first isolsted it, and why
he/she attempted such an experiment).  Once agian any suggestion would be
appreciated.

p.s. My instructer insists that I get 4 rescources from this newsgroup, so
please send me and info you think may be helpful.  Facts that you know,
but don't know what book they're from are ok.
