These mythical treats have a blue raspberry filling, of course. Each one is covered in white icing with a mermaid design on it. The box also says 'mix and match'. Based off of their past mix and match drops like these Sugar Cookie Pop-Tarts that feature animals wearing winter sweaters, we can assume some of these Pop-Tarts have the top half of a mermaid's body and some have the bottom half. You can have pretty food and play with it, too!
