The new offering, the McDonald's Crispy Chicken Sandwich, hits menus today at stores in Knoxville and Houston.
It's a fried chicken sandwich topped with butter and crinkle cut dill pickles on a 'buttery' potato roll
(just like the Popeyes sandwich). A deluxe version has lettuce, tomato, and mayo.
Another innovation: They're served in foil bags, as at Chick-fil-A.
Apparently, McDonald's franchise owners felt serious FOMO over not having a player in the chicken sandwich wars earlier
this year, especially given the sales boost Popeyes experienced as a result: Sandwichmania gave the chain one of its
best quarters in nearly two decades, according to its parent company, with Popeye's sales growing more than 10 percent
in the third quarter of this year. The National Owners Association board, a group of McD's franchisees who sound very
tired of hearing about how good other chains' chicken sandwiches are, wrote in a letter to management earlier this year
that a Chicken Sandwich at McDonald's should be our top priority.
McDonald's wants a piece of that action complete with fries.
